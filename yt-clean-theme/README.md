# YouTube Clean Minimal Theme (MV3)

A minimal, ultra-lightweight Chrome extension that gives YouTube a slightly rounded, modern look with subtle shadows. Customizable radius and shadow strength.

## Install (Load Unpacked)

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right).
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder: `yt-clean-theme`.
4. Open a new `https://www.youtube.com/` tab.

## Customize

- Right-click the extension in the toolbar and choose "Options" (or open from `chrome://extensions`).
- Adjust "Corner radius" and "Shadow strength".
- Changes apply instantly to new YouTube tabs.

## Notes

- The theme is CSS-only on YouTube pages and extremely small.
- No tracking, no network requests. Only uses `storage` permission for your settings.

## Uninstall

- Remove from `chrome://extensions` like any other extension.
